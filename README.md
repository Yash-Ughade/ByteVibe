# 🎵 Finger Volume Controller

A computer vision-based volume controller that uses machine learning to detect hand gestures and control your system volume using the distance between your thumb and index finger.

- **👆 Finger Recognition**: Identifies all 5 fingers individually (Thumb, Index, Middle, Ring, Pinky)
- **📏 Distance-Based Volume Control**: Controls volume based on the distance between thumb and index finger
- **🎯 Real-Time Processing**: Smooth, responsive volume adjustments with minimal latency
- **📊 Visual Feedback**: Real-time volume bar, distance display, and finger labeling
- **⚡ Performance Optimized**: Includes FPS counter and smoothing algorithms
- **🎛️ Interactive Controls**: Keyboard shortcuts for muting, toggling displays, and more

## 🧠 ML & Neural Network Concepts Used

This project incorporates several machine learning and neural network concepts:

1. **MediaPipe Hand Landmarker**: Uses a pre-trained neural network model for:
   - Hand detection in video frames
   - 21 3D hand landmark prediction
   - Hand pose estimation

2. **Computer Vision Pipeline**:
   - Image preprocessing and BGR to RGB conversion
   - Real-time inference on video frames
   - Landmark coordinate normalization

3. **Signal Processing**:
   - Moving average smoothing to reduce noise
   - Distance calculation using Euclidean geometry
   - Linear interpolation for volume mapping

4. **Real-Time Performance**:
   - Efficient neural network inference
   - Frame rate optimization
   - Memory management for continuous processing

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Webcam/Camera
- Windows OS (for volume control functionality)

### Installation

1. **Clone or download this project**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ByteVibe
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Start the application** by running `python main.py`
2. **Position your hand** in front of the camera
3. **Use thumb and index finger distance** to control volume:
   - **Close fingers** (small distance) = **Low volume**
   - **Far apart fingers** (large distance) = **High volume**
4. **Watch the visual feedback**:
   - Green line connects thumb and index finger
   - Volume bar shows current level
   - Finger labels show which fingers are detected

### 🎹 Keyboard Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Q` or `ESC` | Quit application |
| `L` | Toggle finger labels on/off |
| `V` | Toggle volume bar display |
| `M` | Toggle mute/unmute |

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Hand Detection (Neural Networks)
```python
# MediaPipe uses trained neural networks to detect hands
mp_hands = mp.solutions.hands
hands = mp_hands.Hands(min_detection_confidence=0.7)
results = hands.process(rgb_image)
```

### 2. Finger Identification
```python
# 21 hand landmarks are mapped to identify each finger
tip_ids = [4, 8, 12, 16, 20]  # Thumb, Index, Middle, Ring, Pinky
```

### 3. Distance Calculation
```python
# Euclidean distance between thumb (landmark 4) and index (landmark 8)
distance = math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)
```

### 4. Volume Mapping
```python
# Linear interpolation maps distance to volume percentage
volume_percent = np.interp(distance, [min_distance, max_distance], [0, 100])
```

### 5. Smoothing Algorithm
```python
# Moving average reduces jitter for stable volume control
smoothed_distance = np.mean(recent_distances[-window_size:])
```

## 🎛️ Configuration

You can customize the behavior by modifying these parameters:

### Hand Detection Settings
```python
HandDetector(
    detection_confidence=0.7,    # Hand detection confidence threshold
    tracking_confidence=0.5,     # Hand tracking confidence threshold
    max_hands=2                  # Maximum number of hands to detect
)
```

### Volume Control Settings
```python
VolumeController(
    min_distance=30,     # Minimum distance for 0% volume
    max_distance=300     # Maximum distance for 100% volume
)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Camera not detected**:
   - Check if your camera is connected
   - Try changing camera index in `cv2.VideoCapture(0)` to `cv2.VideoCapture(1)`

2. **Volume control not working**:
   - Ensure you're running on Windows
   - Check that pycaw is installed correctly
   - Run as administrator if needed

3. **Hand detection issues**:
   - Ensure good lighting conditions
   - Keep hand clearly visible to camera
   - Try adjusting detection confidence levels

4. **Performance issues**:
   - Close other camera applications
   - Reduce camera resolution if needed
   - Check CPU usage

### Installation Issues

If you encounter dependency issues:

```bash
# Update pip first
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Install dependencies one by one
pip install opencv-python
pip install mediapipe
pip install numpy
pip install pycaw
pip install comtypes
```
